BattleSport
======
This is the repository for 'Scripts' folder of "BattleSport" Unity game project.

Overview
----------------
Striving to get more practice working in Unity, I decided to remake an original 1996 game "BattleSport".

Currently the game has all the base functionality and split-screen multiplayer implemented.

Game Description
----------------
"BattleSport" is a two-player 3D futuristic action football game, where players control their tanks to pick up the ball from the arena 
and throw it to the goal, aiming to score more points than their opponent. In addition, the tanks are equipped with weapons dealing damage, and the arenas have power-ups scattered around them, granting temporary boosts to players.
